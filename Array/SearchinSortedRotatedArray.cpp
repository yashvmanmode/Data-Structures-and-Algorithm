/*You have been given a sorted array/list ARR consisting of ‘N’ elements. You are also given an integer ‘K’.

Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. For example, if ARR = [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 8]. Then after rotating ARR at index 3, the array will be ARR = [7, 8, 1, 3, 5].

Now, your task is to find the index at which ‘K’ is present in ARR.


Note :
1. If ‘K’ is not present in ARR then print -1.
2. There are no duplicate elements present in ARR. 
3. ARR can be rotated only in the right direction.

For example, if ARR = [12, 15, 18, 2, 4] and K = 2, then the position at which K is present in the array is 3 (0-indexed).*/
